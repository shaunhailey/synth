This is a browser-based synthesizer (v1) and sequencer (v2). It is designed to be purposely simple. While it is tons of fun on its own, it is even more fun when used in conjunction with a third party DAW (digital audio workstation).

The goal of this project is to provide a very simple application for a user to quickly transfer basic song structure into a recorded format. Once the basic song structure is complete, the user can then take that basic "sketch" and further work with it in a DAW. This solves the problem of attempting to sketch a simple song idea inside a DAW--modern DAW's provide so many options that it is easy for the original song idea to become lost within the plethora of instruments, sounds, etc within a DAW. This application allows basic melody, harmony, and percussion to be hashed out without the myriad options(distractions) provided within a DAW.
